### Necesary
Copy this scripts to the user folder. Usually at /home/username/ (`~`)

- Change the name from `dwmbar` to `.dwmbar` and then copy it to `~`
- Change the name from `change-layout.sh` to `.change-layout.sh` and then copy it to `~`

### Optional
- Change the name from `rotatescreen.sh` to `.rotatescreen.sh` and then copy it to `~`. See [dotfiles/xbindkeysrc/xbindkeysrc](https://github.com/r4v10l1/arch-files/tree/main/dotfiles/xbindkeysrc).
- Move the `server-ssh.sh` file to the user folder. This script is pretty much useless when you use [`~/.ssh/config`](https://github.com/r4v10l1/arch-files/blob/main/dotfiles/ssh/config)
