### xmodmap

This file is used to remap some keys that I didn't like. In this case for a Lenovo Thinkpad X220.

In this case it remaps the back and forward mouse buttons (`XF86Back` and `XF86Forward`) to page up and page down. This changes the keys next to the arrows in the X220.

Copy this file to `~/.xmodmap`
