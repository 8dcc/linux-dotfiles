### `.rizinrc`

This is the configuration file for [rizin](https://github.com/rizinorg/rizin),
and should be placed inside `~/.rizinrc`. The file is commented so you can
understand and change the settings you like. All the settings can be changed
temporarily at runtime using the same commands in the file (for more
information see output of `e?` inside rizin).
