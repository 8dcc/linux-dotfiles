This repository contains my configuration files and app builds for my usual

my =.bashrc=, =.gdbinit=, =.clang-format=, etc.

The [[file:fonts][fonts]] directory contains some fonts that usually have to be installed
manually.

The [[file:scripts][scripts]] directory contains simple shell scripts for running various commands
or automating simple tasks.
